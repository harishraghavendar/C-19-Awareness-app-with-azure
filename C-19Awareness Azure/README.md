# COVID-19-Awareness
This is one of the first projects that I worked on ever since I started learning web development. Covid had a devastating impact on millions of people worldwide. Nonetheless,  I managed to find something positive! During quarantine, I found a new passion and interest which is web development. The world events happening during the time I started learning web development made me interested in using API and monitoring the statistics.
